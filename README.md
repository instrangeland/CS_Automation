My freshman year, I was taking CS 142. Hated it. Just lots of review, and mostly "learning activities." Then, I realized: all of the activities I had to complete for a score... it didn't care how many attempts they took. And it would still give me credit if I clicked the wrong answer to a multiple choice question after I selected the right one.

So I had but one choice: Make a Python bot to do all of the activities for me. And then just leave it to work. I think it ended up taking about 2 and a half hours or so.

Will this be useful for anyone else? Probably not. It is very basic, to the point that it is resolution & zoom dependant.
