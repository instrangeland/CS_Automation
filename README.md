My freshman year, I was taking CS 142. Hated it. Just super dull, lots of review, and mostly on Zybooks. Then, I realized: all of the activities I had to complete for a score... it didn't care how many attempts they took. And it would still give me credit if I clicked the wrong answer to a multiple choice question after I selected the right one.


So I had but one choice.
Make a Python bot to do all of the dumb activities for me. And then just leave it to work. I think it ended up taking about 2 and a half hours or so.

Will this be useful for anyone else? I certainly hope not. The code is attrocious. But, ehh.
